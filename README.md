# Natural-Language-Processing
 NLP is a field in machine learning with the ability of a computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language.  It is used to read and exploring dataset, pre-processing data (stemming and Lemmatizing),vectorizing data (Bag-Of-Words, N-Grams, TF-IDF, building ML classifiers (model selection, Grid search, Cross validation) and Spam-Ham Classifier. Algorithm: TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) algorithm is used to weigh a keyword in any content and assign importance to that keyword based on the number of times it appears in the document.
